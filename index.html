          <a href="https://github.com/eobrain/videogestalt">Video Gestalt</a> is
          a new implementaton of an invention that I was awarded a
          <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8301669B2">patent</a> for
          when I worked at HP Labs many years ago. I was frustrated that HP
          never did anything with it, so after the patent expired I created this
          new implementation. It is basically a way of summarizing a long video
          as a short video with many thumbnails of the originalvideo playing in
          parallel.

          <a href="https://github.com/eobrain/bajel">Bajel</a> reflects my
          nostalgia for Makefiles when working in a NPM JavaScript development
          stack. I really liked the model in Makefiles where build targets are
          files and the timestamps of the files are used to determine what needs
          to be built. It's a pure-JavaScript implementation and is controlled
          by buildfiles in JSON, or in various formats that convert to JSON,
          like YAML and TOML. For power users, you can write the build files in
          JavaScript for ultimate flexibility.

          <a href="https://github.com/eobrain/almondbread">Almond Bread</a>
          reflects my fascination dor the Mandelbrot set. I built an interactive
          explorer to find interesting parts of the set zooming way down deep. I
          also added ways to capture images and zooming videos.

          <a href="https://github.com/eobrain/maxichrome">Maxichrome</a> is a
          JavaScript library that generates sets of colors that are maximally
          different from each according to human perception of colors. This can
          be useful for picking colors for graphs or coloring maps.

            >Classless Tufte CSS</a
          >
          is an experiment to bring the elegance of Edward Tufte's style of
          graphic design to the web, with the simplicity of a pure semantic
          classless HTML/CSS style. This page is an example of its use, and I
          encourage you to "view source" this page to see the semantic
          simplicity of the HTML code. The linked repo gives more details,
          including credit to the original developers of the repo from which
          this was adapted. Trying it out with your own pages is easy,
          especially if you already are using a semantic HTML. You just need to
          add a single line in the header to include the CSS.

          <a href="https://github.com/eobrain/funcgo">Funcgo</a> was a reaction
          to my first exposure to the Go programming language, having previously
          drunk the functional programming Kool-Aid. I really liked the clean
          syntax of Go, but I really wanted it to allow for functional
          programming. So like any slef-respecting computer scientist I designed
          my own language with a syntax similar to go, but with the semantics of
          Clojure, a dialect of Lisp that runs on the JVM or JavaScript.

            Note, the <a href="http://www.funcgo.org/">funcgo.org</a> is so old
            that it doesn't have a HTTPS support. Until I fix that you will get
            a security warning when you visit the site.

        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/eobrain/simplestblog">Simplest Blog</a> is
          an example of the rule that every software developer who attempts to
          blog invariably ends up creating their own blogging platform. This one
          is probably the fourth one I built over the years, but in this case I
          wanted to really push the limits of simplicity as far as possible.

            An example instance is a copy of the blog I've been writing off and
            on for more than twenty years. You can find that hosted on GitHub

            and links that I still need to fix.)
