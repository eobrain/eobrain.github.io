          <t-newthought>You cannot search</t-newthought> for everything on
          Mastodon. You can search for what your server knows about, based on
          what you and other people on your server have followed and boosted.
          <t-sidenote
            >Your administrator might also block some servers that are not
            compatible with the ethos of your server.
          </t-sidenote>
        </p>

        <p>
          That is deliberate for two reasons. Firstly Mastodon wants to avoid
          having any central place for searching.
          <t-sidenote
            >That would provide a choke point for one organization to exert
            monopoly control, and provide a tempting convenient target for
            governments armed with subpoena or coercive powers.</t-sidenote
          >
          Secondly Mastodon does not want to make it <em>too</em> easy to find
          everything on Mastodon.
          <t-sidenote
            >That would make it too easy for trolls and bullies to find victims
            to harass.</t-sidenote
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Hashtags provide a nice compromise. If you add one to your post you
          are implicitly advertising that you want your post to be found via
          that hashtag. So Mastodon makes it possible to search by hashtag, but
          only for those that your server knows about. If your server is getting
          a flow of data from many other servers then you may be able to find
          what you want by searching via your server. If you want to search more
          widely you can use this site.
