        Some programming projects I've built over the years for my own

          <a href="https://github.com/eobrain/videogestalt">Video Gestalt</a> is
          a new implementaton of an invention that I was awarded a
          <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8301669B2">patent</a> for
          when I worked at HP Labs many years ago. I was frustrated that HP
          never did anything with it, so after the patent expired I created this
          new implementation. It is basically a way of summarizing a long video
          as a short video with many thumbnails of the originalvideo playing in
          parallel.

          <a href="https://github.com/eobrain/flife">flife</a> answers the
          question: what would a cellular automata look like if you were not
          restircted to a discrete number of values per cell? This is a
          floating-point variant of Conway's Game of Life, where the update rule
          is a continuous-value function rather than a Boolean function. It
          looks even more like "life" than Conway's version, albeit the kind of
          life you find on a Petri dish.

          <a href="https://github.com/eobrain/tootgeist">tootgeist</a> is a web
          app that helps make it easier to join the Mastodon social network. The
          main barrier to people joining is the deciding which of the individual
          Mastodon servers to join. It shows a card for each of the major
          servers, and for each one it shows avatars of the people who have been
          posting recently, and (if you wait a few minutes), a wordcloud of what
          topics those people are posting about. It is worth noting though that
          no matter what server you join you can generally see and interact with
          posts from people on other servers in the Mastodon community. The main
          differences between servers is how they do moderation, that is, what
          standards do they apply to decide to block a user or a server.

          <a href="https://github.com/eobrain/warp">Warp</a> is ia a many-body
          gravitational simulation that
          <a href="https://eobrain.github.io/warp/">runs in your browser</a>.
          You can start the simulation with any number of astronimical objects,
          and you can vary their mass from 10 Jupiters (1% Sun mass) to 10,000
          Jupiters (10 Suns). The simulation runs in a cube of sides two AU
          (i.e. twice the distance from the Earth and the Sun). Because the time
          scale of motions can vary greatly dependng on the masses and how far
          apart they are, the simulation automatically adjusts the time step to
          keep the motions slow enought that the simlation remains accurate,
          while making it fast enought to not be boring to watch. The URL
          captures the parameters of the simulation so you can bookmark or share
          any interesting configuration you discover. For example an initial
          configuration of<a
            href="https://eobrain.github.io/warp/?edge=slide&n=2&jupiters=2"
            >100 object each 1% of the Sun's mass</a
          >
          evolves over a year of simulated time into a small number of large
          stars with smaller objects in intermittent unstable orbits around
          them.

          <a href="https://github.com/eobrain/bajel">Bajel</a> reflects my
          nostalgia for Makefiles when working in a NPM JavaScript development
          stack. I really liked the model in Makefiles where build targets are
          files and the timestamps of the files are used to determine what needs
          to be built. It's a pure-JavaScript implementation and is controlled
          by buildfiles in JSON, or in various formats that convert to JSON,
          like YAML and TOML. For power users, you can write the build files in
          JavaScript for ultimate flexibility.

          is an experiment to bring the elegance of Edward Tufte's style of
          graphic design to the web, with the simplicity of a pure semantic
          classless HTML/CSS style. This page is an example of its use, and I
          encourage you to "view source" this page to see the semantic
          simplicity of the HTML code. The linked repo gives more details,
          including credit to the original developers of the repo from which
          this was adapted. Trying it out with your own pages is easy,
          especially if you already are using a semantic HTML. You just need to
          add a single line in the header to include the CSS.

          <a href="https://github.com/eobrain/funcgo">Funcgo</a> was a reaction
          to my first exposure to the Go programming language, having previously
          drunk the functional programming Kool-Aid. I really liked the clean
          syntax of Go, but I really wanted it to allow for functional
          programming. So like any slef-respecting computer scientist I designed
          my own language with a syntax similar to go, but with the semantics of
          Clojure, a dialect of Lisp that runs on the JVM or JavaScript.

            An example instance is a copy of the blog I've been writing off and
            on for more than twenty years. You can find that hosted on GitHub
            Pages at
            <a href="https://eobrain.github.io/mysimplestblog/"
              >mysimplestblog</a
            >. (The export from another version of this blog broke a few images
            and links that I still need to fix.)

          is my latest project, still in progress to create an interactive world
          history map where you can scroll back and forwards in history looking
          at how the world political map has changed over time. To simplify the
          data gathering, I divided the world into hexagonal tiles (using a
          scheme dividised by Uber). Each tile is about the size of a small
          European country or US state, so there are unavoidable approximations.
          The web UI displays an interactive world map and a time chart,
          together showing the various political entites that controlled each
          area over the last millenium. As of now (June 2025) the data is still
          incomplete, with black areas showing areas of missing data.
