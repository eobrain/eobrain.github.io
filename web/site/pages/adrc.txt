Strategic Planning for the Expansion of California's Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC) Network
==========================================

Client: California State Independent Living Council (SILC)

Currently Mission Analytics Group is working with the California State
Independent Living Council (SILC), in partnership with the California
Health and Human Services Agency (CHHS), to develop a strategic plan
for statewide expansion of Californiaâ€™s network of Aging and
Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs). The final strategic plan will
have four components: criteria for designating new ADRCs; standards
for determining how entities should partner to form an ADRC (e.g.,
Area Agencies on Aging and Independent Living Centers); a plan for
publicizing the services provided by ADRCs (such as options counseling
and remote assessment); and an estimation of how much the Medicaid
program will save when individuals are diverted away from facilities
and institutional care. The strategic plan will have input from an
Advisory Committee that meets bi-monthly and from groups of
stakeholders convened in different parts of the state.
