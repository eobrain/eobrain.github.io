To modify an existing Glan web site. you will need to make changes as follows

1. Edit the file [web/site/config.json](web/site/config.json) to set the
title of the web site and other properties.
2. Replace the image [web/site/logo.png](web/site/logo.png) with your logo
3. Edit the file [web/site/footer.txt](web/site/footer.txt) to set the
text that goes on the bottom of each page.
4. Edit the file [web/site/structure.json](web/site/structure.json) to
specify all the pages in your web site and how they are arranged
hierarchically.
5. For every entry in the `structure.json` add a `.txt` file in
Markdown format in
[web/site/pages/](web/site/pages/).  For example
[web/site/pages/home.txt](web/site/pages/home.txt) is the home page. 
6. Specify rotating images in [web/site/rotimg/](web/site/rotimg/)
