Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS): Technical Assistance to States
========================================================================

Client:  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)

Under subcontract to New Editions Consulting, Mission Analytics Group helps CMS provide states with individual technical assistance to navigate Medicaid waivers and state plan options for offering Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) to individuals who are aged and/or have physical, intellectual, and mental disabilities. To determine the level and means of assistance needed, Mission Analytics Group reviews the regulatory environment in which HCBS programs operate, much of which has changed since the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and the adoption of Medicaid managed care programs in many states. Technical assistance will be provided through a website, peer education, individually tailored reports and presentations, webinars, and direct consultations between expert consultants and state staff.
