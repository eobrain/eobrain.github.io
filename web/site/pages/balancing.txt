Balancing Incentive Payments Program - No Wrong Door Initiative Technical Assistance (Medicaid)
===============================================================================================

Client: Centers for Medicaid and Medicaid Services (CMS)

Mission Analytics Group, under subcontract to Acumen, LLC, wrote the manual for and serves as the technical assistance contractor for CMSâ€™s Balancing Incentive Program, an Affordable Care Act initiative that provides incentives to states to rebalance their long-term services and supports (LTSS) systems toward community-based care. Participating states must implement three structural changes: a No Wrong Door/Single Entry Point (NWD/SEP) System for enrollment into community LTSS; a Core Standardized Assessment (CSA); and conflict-free case management.
