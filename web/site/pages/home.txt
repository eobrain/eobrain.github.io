Mission Analytics Group is the evaluator for the San Francisco Family Resource Center (FRC) Initiative, funded by First 5 San Francisco, the San Francisco Human Services Agency and the Department for Children, Youth and Their Families.  The second year evaluation report examines the scope of FRC activities and their effect on family engagement, family functioning, parenting skills and reunification of children in foster care.

Mission Analytics Group is currently the evaluator of the San
Francisco Violence Prevention and Intervention Initiative (VPI) and
Youth Workforce Development â€“ High Risk (YWD-HR) program.  This
Executive Brief reviews findings from our mid-period evaluation which
examined the services provided to at-risk and youth involved in the
juvenile justice system to identify which youth participated in the
Initiative, how programs served juvenile justice-involved youth, and
what were preliminary outcomes for participating youth.
