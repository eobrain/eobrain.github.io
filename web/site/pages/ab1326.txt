Planning and Evaluation for AB1326 and SB701, San Mateo County and San Francisco County Individualized Child Care Subsidy Pilots
============================================

Clients: San Mateo County Child Care Partnership Council, San Francisco Child Care Planning and Advisory Council

Mission Analytics Group provides planning support and evaluation of these two pilot projects.  The pilots allow San Francisco and San Mateo Counties to address two fundamental concerns: first, that families barely earning enough to meet the high cost of housing in the counties are nevertheless considered too high income to qualify for child care subsidies; and second, that the state reimbursement rates for providers contracted to provide high quality child care are so low that providers cannot cover their costs. Evaluation criteria include the retention of contracted providers, income growth and child care stability for families, and the increase in number of children served in contracted slots in the counties.
