Deploying to HP Cloud
=====================

Prerequisites
-------------
* A Unix-like command line shell, such as on Linux, Mac, or Cygwin
* `make`, which is likely already installed on your Unix-like system
* The [HP Cloud Unix command-line-interface] [1]
* `python` for running a local test Web server

On Ubuntu and similar Linux systems you can install necessary
dependencies by doing
