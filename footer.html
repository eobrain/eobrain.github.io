  <t-newthought>Unlike almost every</t-newthought> other web site, the creator
  of this site has not added any tracking or any other data gathering that would
  infringe your privacy.
</p>
<p>
  Because of this, we have no idea if anyone is using this site, if they are
  finding it useful, or if there are changes we could make to improve the site.

  So we would greatly appreciate any feedback or questions by posting to
  Mastodon with the <bold>#AllMasto</bold> hashtag. Even just a note to say you
  found this site and tried it out would be great.
